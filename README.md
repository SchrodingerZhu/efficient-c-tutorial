# Efficient C Programming using MIPS

## Objectives

By reading C codes and their corresponding MIPS codes, have a basic idea of systems' programming and the memory model.

## How to run?

1. Clone the project to a VM or Docker with `mipsel` and `qemu` installed. You can use this Docker: [https://github.com/SchrodingerZhu/csc3050-docker](https://github.com/SchrodingerZhu/csc3050-docker).
2. To compile and run any program, execute `make run TARGET=XXX`, e.g. `make run TARGET=question1`.
3. To remove the MIPS code and executable for one program, execute `make clean TARGET=XXX`.

## Suggested Path:

1. question1
2. question2
3. question3
4. functionPointer
5. structMem
6. structMem2
7. structMem3
8. structCasting
9. I strongly recommend you to read [`Redis`'s source codes](https://github.com/redis) if you want to be a fluent C programmer. (PS: You may read a stable branch rather than the unstable one.)
